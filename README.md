### Concussion Recovery Prediction Project

This project aims to provide personalized recovery recommendations for individuals experiencing symptoms following a concussion. The core functionality involves a web-based form where users can input the severity of their symptoms. The backend processes this data to generate a total score and specific recommendations based on the symptom severity.

#### Key Features:

1. **Symptom Input Form:**
   - Users select the severity of various symptoms (e.g., Headache, Neck Pain, Nausea) from a predefined list.
   - The form is dynamically generated and organized into three columns for better user experience.

2. **Symptom Scoring:**
   - Each symptom has an associated weight, and the severity is mapped to a numerical value.
   - The total score is calculated by multiplying the symptom weight by the severity value.
   - The total score and individual symptom scores are used to determine the severity of the condition.

3. **Recommendations Generation:**
   - Based on the scores, the system generates specific recommendations to aid in recovery.
   - Recommendations are tailored to the severity of each symptom and include general advice as well as medical guidance for more severe cases.
   - The recommendations are displayed below the form upon submission.

5. **User Interface:**
   - The interface is designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing, with a clean layout and responsive design.
   - Background and styling elements provide a calming and professional appearance, enhancing the overall user experience.

This project combines frontend user interaction with backend data processing to deliver a helpful tool for individuals recovering from a concussion. The system leverages medical guidelines and best practices to offer actionable advice, supporting users in their recovery journey.
